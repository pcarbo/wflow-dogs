*Add introductory text here.*

```{r knitr-opts, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(comment = "#",collapse = TRUE,results = "hold",
                      fig.align = "center")
```

Read the height, weight and age-of-death (AOD) data for different
dog breeds. These data accompany [Jones
et al, 2008][jones-2008].

```{r}
dogs <- read.csv("../data/dogs.csv",stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

Fit a line for AOD vs. body weight (in pounds).

```{r}
fit <- lm(AOD ~ weight,dogs)
b   <- coef(fit)
```

Plot AOD vs. body weight, along with the best-fit line (dashed, blue
line). Compare with Figure 4 from Jones et al (2008).

```{r}
ggplot(dogs,aes(x = weight,y = AOD)) +
  geom_point(color = "black") +
  geom_abline(intercept = b["(Intercept)"],slope = b["weight"],
              color = "darkorange",linetype = "dashed") +
  theme_cowplot()
```
